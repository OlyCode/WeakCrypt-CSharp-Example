WeakCrypt C# Example is a simple program that demonstrates encryption using an iterated SHA256 hash as a stream cypher. The program then uses SHA512 hash with 100 times as many iterations to provide (at least computationally) stronger encryption.

WeakCrypt's diminutive title refers to the fact that cryptography is easy to do wrong. Using a secure hash algorithm as a stream cypher is not necessarily cryptographically the best idea.
